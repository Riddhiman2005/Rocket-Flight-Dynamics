The process of launching rockets into space is far more complex than what can be explained by Newton's laws of motion alone. While Newton's laws provide a foundation, numerous other factors and considerations come into play in the design and operation of rockets that can achieve orbit and travel to interplanetary destinations.

One crucial aspect is the role of air pressure when the rocket is still within the Earth's atmosphere. ***The internal pressure generated by burning rocket propellants in the combustion chamber must exceed the external pressure to escape through the engine nozzle***. The outside air acts as a barrier, requiring the internal pressure to surpass the ambient pressure just to overcome this resistance. As a result, the velocity of the combustion products passing through the nozzle opening is reduced. However, as the rocket ascends into space, the ambient pressure decreases as the atmosphere becomes thinner, allowing the engine thrust to increase.

The changing mass of the rocket also plays a significant role. As the rocket accelerates upward, it experiences thrust due to external pressure changes. Additionally, as the rocket burns propellant, its mass decreases. The burning propellant has mass, and as the combustion products are expelled, the overall mass of the vehicle decreases. Consequently, the rocket's inertia, or resistance to changes in motion, diminishes, leading to an increase in upward acceleration.

Practically speaking, Newton's second law can be expressed as follows:

$F = m_{\text{exit}} \cdot V_{\text{exit}} + (P_{\text{exit}} - P_{\text{ambient}}) \cdot A_{\text{exit}}$


Here, "F" represents the force acting on the rocket, "m" is the mass, "V" denotes the velocity, "P" signifies the pressure, and "$A_{\text{exit}}$" represents the area of the engine throat. When the rocket reaches space and the pressure difference between the exit and ambient becomes zero, the equation simplifies to:

$F = m_{\text{exit}} \cdot V_{\text{exit}}$

In reality, numerous other factors influence rocket science. For instance:

### Acceleration Accumulation ### 

Even with low acceleration, a rocket gradually gains speed over time since acceleration accumulates.

### Propellant Selection ### 
Not all rocket propellants are the same. Some exhibit greater thrust due to their burning rate and mass. However, propellant choice is not solely based on energy efficiency. Each selection made by rocket scientists involves trade-offs. For example, while liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are highly energetic when burned, they need to be kept at extremely low temperatures, and large tanks are required to hold enough propellant for the mission.

Overall, understanding rocket science involves considering a multitude of factors beyond Newton's laws of motion. Air pressure, changing mass, and the choice of propellants are just a few examples of the complex elements involved in designing and launching rockets into space. By comprehending and accounting for these factors, scientists and engineers can develop sophisticated systems that propel humans and payloads beyond Earth's atmosphere, enabling space exploration and scientific advancements.
